You may write the assignments on paper and then scan them as a PDF (there are several such apps available for all phone platforms), or write on a tablet and convert to PDF, or type using a word processor.\nThere will no make-up examination for students who miss a mid-term.\n\nStudent who miss the exam due to a valid reason (see Faculty of Engineering policy) should notify the instructor within a week of the exam and provide necessary documentation.\nIf, and only if, proper documentation for a missed exam is presented, the marks for the missed exam will be shifted to the final exam.\nStudents who miss the mid-term exam for any other reason (e.g., no medical note, going to the exam at the wrong time, or on the wrong day, etc.) will get zero marks on the exam.\n\nAny request for reevaluation of a mid-term or an assignment must be made in writing within a week of its return. Note that requesting a re-grade will mean that you WHOLE assignment or exam will be re-graded.\nDue to paucity of grading hours, only one or two randomly selected questions will be graded in each assignment.\nThe lowest two assignments and labs will be dropped. There will be no make-up for missed assignments and labs, even if it is for a valid reason. The whole point of dropping the lowest two assignments/labs is to reduce the administrative overhead of keeping track of such missed assignments/labs.\n\n\nRight to submit in English or French written work that is to be graded.\n\nIn accord with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nMcGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see McGill’s guide to academic honesty for more information).\nL’université McGill attache une haute importance à l’honnêteté académique. Il incombe par conséquent à tous les étudiants de comprendre ce que l’on entend par tricherie, plagiat et autres infractions académiques, ainsi que les conséquences que peuvent avoir de telles actions, selon le Code de conduite de l’étudiant et des procédures disciplinaires (pour de plus amples renseignements, veuillez consulter le guide pour l’honnêteté académique de McGill.)"
